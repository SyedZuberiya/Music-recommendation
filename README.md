# ðŸŽµ Music Recommendation System

A machine learning-based music recommendation system that suggests songs to users based on their listening history, preferences, and user-item interactions. The model is built using collaborative filtering techniques, utilizing user and song data to recommend personalized tracks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The music recommendation system uses collaborative filtering to predict and recommend songs based on user preferences. By analyzing user-song interaction data (e.g., ratings, likes, listens), the system provides personalized song recommendations. We used models like Matrix Factorization, KNN, and Neural Networks for efficient recommendation generation.

## âœ… Features

- Personalized music recommendations based on user behavior
- Option to integrate multiple models like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models
- Evaluation metrics to assess recommendation performance (e.g., Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
- Simple interface to get recommendations from a trained model

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Dataset**: [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/)
  - The dataset contains user-song interaction data, such as ratings, listening history, and metadata for songs.
  - Alternatively, you can use a custom dataset of user-song interactions (ratings, likes, or listens).
  
- **Columns**:
  - `user_id`: ID of the user
  - `song_id`: ID of the song
  - `rating`: Rating given by the user (optional, can be replaced by like/dislike)
  - `timestamp`: When the song was played/liked by the user

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning-based recommendation models)
- Surprise (for collaborative filtering models)
- Flask / Streamlit (for UI-based recommendation app)
